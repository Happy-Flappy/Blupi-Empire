GOALS:



Change networking code to allow networking by server without VPN.





BUGS TO FIX:


1: Startstop command ,although delays stopping till task complete, causes progress bar to display nothing.

Main variables involved:

Blupi::doAction()

Blupi::actionTime - float

Blupi::progressTime - sf::Clock


2:Blupi does not stop growing tomatoes in time before he uses all of his energy.



3:TopLayer selection method cannot detect blupi if it is over another blupi. This can lead to the user losing complete control of both blupis if the user clicks on a third blupi. Obviously, the toplayer method is only successful for the elements.
